	abstract = {We investigate the expressive power of MATLANG, a formal language for matrix manipulation based on common matrix operations and linear algebra. The language can be extended with the operation inv for inverting a matrix. In MATLANG + inv, we can compute the transitive closure of directed graphs, whereas we show that this is not possible without inversion. Indeed, we show that the basic language can be simulated in the relational algebra with arithmetic operations, grouping, and summation. We also consider an operation eigen for diagonalizing a matrix. It is defined such that for each eigenvalue a set of mutually orthogonal eigenvectors is returned that span the eigenspace of that eigenvalue. We show that inv can be expressed in MATLANG + eigen. We put forward the open question whether there are Boolean queries about matrices, or generic queries about graphs, expressible in MATLANG + eigen but not in MATLANG + inv. Finally, the evaluation problem for MATLANG + eigen is shown to be complete for the complexity class ∃ R.},

	abstract = {Linear algebra algorithms often require some sort of iteration or recursion as is illustrated by standard algorithms for Gaussian elimination, matrix inversion, and transitive closure. A key characteristic shared by these algorithms is that they allow looping for a number of steps that is bounded by the matrix dimension. In this paper we extend the matrix query language MATLANG with this type of recursion, and show that this suffices to express classical linear algebra algorithms. We study the expressive power of this language and show that it naturally corresponds to arithmetic circuit families, which are often said to capture linear algebra. Furthermore, we analyze several sub-fragments of our language, and show that their expressive power is closely tied to logical formalisms on semiring-annotated relations.},
