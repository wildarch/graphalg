# Integrating GraphAlg
GraphAlg is designed to be integrated into existing systems, particularly Database Management Systems.
If you are a (prospective) GraphAlg user looking for a way to run GraphAlg programs, see the [available GraphAlg integrations](./available).

Are you a system developer and you want an easy way to let users run custom algorithms in your system, see our [guide to integrating GraphAlg in a new system](./new_integration).
