# Available GraphAlg Integrations
The following systems allow running GraphAlg programs.

## AvantGraph
[AvantGraph](https://avantgraph.io/) is a Graph Data Management System developed by the [TU Eindhoven Database group](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/research-groups/data-science/data-and-artificial-intelligence/database-group) that also develops GraphAlg.
GraphAlg algorithms can be embedded in Cypher queries.
Queries and algorithms are optimized and executed together in a unified query pipeline, allowing for optimizations that cross the boundary between query and algorithm.

## GraphAlg Playground
The [GraphAlg Playground](../playground) is an online platfrom for experimenting with GraphAlg.
It provides:
- An interactive editor with syntax highlighting and integrated error diagnostics
- A fully-featured GraphAlg compiler, running locally in the browser
- a WebAssembly backend to run GraphAlg programs in the browser
